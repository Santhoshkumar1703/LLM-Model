Guyss 
This is really the all-inclusive interaction that we need 
Full of seniors, juniors, irrespective of ranks 
Utkarsh sir first proposed creating the culture of fireside chats 
We can play games, have long talks (just like walks after dinner on campus), do whatever we want 

So, for this obviously we will have the 2020 batch, and also senior volunteers (one of whom can be the leader) 
Every week a group of seniors, juniors will meet 
And the next week the group will be randomly shuffled 😁

Thanks for listening to my bhasan...if you like this...please fill it 😃🙏🏻

It's been a little time that you joined the institute, and in this short period, you may have heard "competitive coding" a lot. You all may have a lot of questions regarding the same.

In order to answer all your queries regarding competitive coding and coding in general, TSoC has invited Mr. Jai Dewani and Ms. Saanika Gupta (both of Batch 2017) to have a session with you all. Mr. Jai Dewani is one of the founders of TSoC. It's the effort and hard work of him and his colleagues that TSoC is what you see today. Ms. Saanika Gupta is an upcoming Amazon intern, ex-Nasdaq intern and also the winner of Genpact's 2020 Hackathon.

In this session, we will be discussing with them the importance of competitive coding and how does it help in placements and interviews, which would be followed by a quick QnA.

The session will take place on Friday, 18th December 2020 at 6:00 PM.

12/23/20, 3:30 PM - +91 99825 03901: To ve dono parellel hi hue?
12/23/20, 3:31 PM - +91 88899 30610: Nahi

To dono ke Direction ratios same..


Direction ratios same to dono parellel ...
12/23/20, 3:33 PM - +91 94254 25099: are lekin parallel vectors ke perpendicular bhi to skta h na u 
que me ye thodi na diya h ki v and w are non-parallel
12/23/20, 3:33 PM - +91 91111 57786: Sry meko ye ny pata tha
12/23/20, 3:33 PM - +91 88899 30610: Then this ?
12/23/20, 3:33 PM - +91 99825 03901: We're only talking about sometimes in C na?
12/23/20, 3:34 PM - +91 88899 30610: Yeah c he hoga
12/23/20, 3:34 PM - +91 88514 14210: Haa c hoga
12/23/20, 3:34 PM - +91 88899 30610: Koi mail kiya ?
12/23/20, 3:34 PM - +91 90391 98542: u = v cross w
u = vu sin(theta)
If they are parallel theta = 0 and u=0(which is not the case)
12/23/20, 3:34 PM - +91 83193 75111: Haa C hoga
12/23/20, 3:34 PM - +91 99825 03901: Sir ko mail kro sab
12/23/20, 3:35 PM - +91 88899 30610: Koi akh karo with example

12/23/20, 3:35 PM - +91 88514 14210: Arrey u should be proportional to v x w
12/23/20, 3:35 PM - +91 88514 14210: Which is still the case
12/23/20, 3:36 PM - +91 88899 30610: Nahi 3D may
12/23/20, 3:36 PM - +91 88514 14210: Technically dekhe toh
12/23/20, 3:36 PM - +91 99825 03901: 3d mein bana le
12/23/20, 3:36 PM - +91 88899 30610: Like this
12/23/20, 3:36 PM - +91 99825 03901: Rul
12/23/20, 3:36 PM - +91 99825 03901: Ruko
12/23/20, 3:36 PM - +91 88514 14210: Dono correct ho sakta hai... That's why...
12/23/20, 3:36 PM - +91 88514 14210: C
12/23/20, 3:36 PM - +91 88899 30610: @919982503901 tu example k sath mail kar

12/23/20, 3:37 PM - +91 94551 32136: Tru
12/23/20, 3:38 PM - +91 79820 54591: But ye bhi hoskta h na ki vo same plane pe ho dono
12/23/20, 3:38 PM - +91 79820 54591: Then they can be parallel
12/23/20, 3:39 PM - +91 79820 54591: There is a possibility I think?🤔
12/23/20, 3:39 PM - +91 94551 32136: Tru, we can't rule out this possibility
12/23/20, 3:40 PM - +91 88878 74339: Yes
12/23/20, 3:41 PM - +91 88514 14210: We shouldn't even be talking about that... Vectors ko toh marzi ke hisaab se shift kar sakte hain na....
12/23/20, 3:42 PM - +91 91111 57786: Exactly For every value of v,w ke liye to vo parallel ny hoga
12/23/20, 3:43 PM - +91 99825 03901: -1,-1,0 and -2,-2,0 are both perpendicular to 1,1,1
and both are parellel
12/23/20, 3:44 PM - +91 88514 14210: Yes.... Exactly
12/23/20, 3:45 PM - +91 73004 21968: NO they are not

It gives me immense pleasure to apprise you that we look forward to collaborating with your esteemed institution for participation in the Python workshop organized by IIT Bombay mentors.

This workshop will cover a plethora of topics from basics of Python ,variables and data types, loops, functions, to advanced topics like building a Todo Application, an Instagram Image Downloader and a Hangman Game with Python . Apart from this, placement and competition preparation tips will be an added bonus! Being Interview ready with Python will be the focus. In the end, students will have most needed coding skills to compete in coding contests and ace their placements.

We have helped 10000+ students from various colleges across Mumbai, Delhi, Pune, Gurgaon with these workshops to get rid of Python fears and gain interest in coding along with technical skills. We keenly look forward to associating with you.

Certificates will be provided to students to enhance their resume, and top performers at the end of the quiz will be awarded special certificates that would stand out in their resume. 

This live workshop is completely free of cost. It consists of a total of 5 hour classes ,split to 2 days, on the weekend of your choice with an opportunity to interact, ask doubts live and code along with the instructor.
To summarise : For the best, from the best!

12/24/20, 1:33 PM - +91 73895 74818: Try using float instead of int

12/24/20, 1:34 PM - +91 73895 74818: Try using all variables in double
12/24/20, 1:34 PM - +91 88899 30610: use division as float and
division = a/(float)b
12/24/20, 1:35 PM - +91 88899 30610: Type casting is necessary here
12/24/20, 1:35 PM - +91 73004 21968: <Media omitted>
12/24/20, 1:36 PM - +91 88899 30610: Cause *int = int/int* but *float = int/float* and *float = float/int*

12/24/20, 1:38 PM - +91 88899 30610: Use *clang* if you are on Mac much better than *gcc*
12/24/20, 1:38 PM - +91 73895 74818: In that case it should work with int but it's not
12/24/20, 1:38 PM - +91 99825 03901: Im using clang haha
12/24/20, 1:39 PM - +91 73895 74818: Ok so compiler problem

12/26/20, 10:33 AM - +91 88899 30610: Greetings!

TSoC is back this weekend, with more awesome stuff to share with you all! This weekend we will focus on Git and GitHub, and teach you how to show off your code to the rest of the world.

Git is something that you'll use in the real world, and knowing it will give you an extra edge over the rest. Sadly, it is barely focused upon in any course. But we are not just anyone!

Come over and join us tomorrow at 11:00 AM at Google Meet. By the end of the session you'll have your own website   ;-)

Link will be shared tomorrow morning by 10:30 AM. It would be nice if you create an account on GitHub there beforehand. (It's so easy even a caveman can do it!).


Regards,
Team TSoC

12/26/20, 1:07 PM - +91 88899 30610: Plagiarism might result in marks deduction
12/26/20, 1:07 PM - +91 73895 74818: Sahi baat hai
12/26/20, 1:07 PM - +91 88899 30610: ques 3
12/26/20, 1:08 PM - +91 88899 30610: recap:
12/26/20, 1:09 PM - +91 88899 30610: Two ways of doing that q :
1) co ordinate circle parametric form
2) complex number rotation formula
12/26/20, 1:10 PM - +91 73895 74818: Kaha kar re ho bhai discord pe toh nhi ho
12/26/20, 1:10 PM - +91 88899 30610: Then finally find a matrix that would do same thing
12/26/20, 1:10 PM - +91 88899 30610: Katam jo gaya
12/26/20, 1:11 PM - +91 88899 30610: Ho

12/26/20, 9:02 PM - +91 73895 74818: Kuldip sir ne reference books me kaunsi prefer ki thi kisi ko yaad hai kya Hoffman ya schaums
12/26/20, 10:08 PM - +91 90391 98542: Hoffman
12/26/20, 10:08 PM - +91 73895 74818: Ok

12/26/20, 10:16 PM - +91 79746 59860: Agar krra hun to b^-1 kaise nikalu?
12/26/20, 10:17 PM - +91 79746 59860: 4X4 ka inverse to elementary row transformation se bhi aa gaya tha
12/26/20, 10:22 PM - +91 75870 75631: Same problm
12/26/20, 10:23 PM - +91 79746 59860: :(
12/26/20, 11:02 PM - +91 73895 74818: b-1 kyu chahiye??
12/26/20, 11:03 PM - +91 79746 59860: Usme kaha h na..
12/26/20, 11:03 PM - +91 79746 59860: <Media omitted>
12/26/20, 11:04 PM - +91 79746 59860: Agar elementary row transformation se krna hai tab to ban jayega 😌
12/26/20, 11:04 PM - +91 73895 74818: Bhai vo A-1 bola hai vaise bhi rectangular matrix ke inverse course me ni hai.
12/26/20, 11:05 PM - +91 79746 59860: Tab thik hai yaar to elementary row transformation se kr lun na a-1
12/26/20, 11:05 PM - +91 73895 74818: Ha kar sakta hai
12/26/20, 11:06 PM - +91 79746 59860: Okay😀
12/26/20, 11:32 PM - +91 75870 75631: Btw rectangular matrix ka inverse hota bhi nhi hai
12/26/20, 11:34 PM - +91 91095 55992: Rectangular inverse to hai hi ni assignment me🤷‍♂
12/26/20, 11:35 PM - +91 91095 55992: Matrix*
12/26/20, 11:38 PM - +91 75870 75631: Wo (b-1) nikalne k liye
12/26/20, 11:39 PM - +91 91095 55992: Kaha likha hai b inverse nikalna hai?
12/26/20, 11:40 PM - +91 73895 74818: Are vo thoda confuse hogaya tha bas aur kuch ni vo A-1 nikalne ke liye b-1 chah rha tha.
12/26/20, 11:41 PM - +91 91095 55992: Ok
12/26/20, 11:41 PM - +91 91095 55992: Simple A inverse bhi to nikal skte hai na
12/26/20, 11:44 PM - +91 75870 75631: par question mein aisa sense a rha tha ki( A-1) ki value direct na nikal k x=(A-1)b se nikalna hoga jo possible nhi hai
12/26/20, 11:44 PM - +91 75870 75631: thats why confusion
12/26/20, 11:44 PM - +91 75870 75631: btw third ques ho gya kya?

12/27/20, 3:01 PM - +91 70244 45718: The question says to find inverse using the equation -  x=A(inverse)×b
12/27/20, 3:10 PM - +91 99825 03901: Sir ne hame determinant padhaya kya?
12/27/20, 3:10 PM - +91 99825 03901: Use kr sakte hain , 4th question mein?
12/27/20, 3:13 PM - +91 73895 74818: Augmented matrix se kar lena
12/27/20, 3:23 PM - +91 79746 59860: Bhai first part ka matlab kya hai
12/27/20, 3:24 PM - +91 79746 59860: Question 4 me
12/27/20, 3:24 PM - +91 79746 59860: <Media omitted>
12/27/20, 3:24 PM - +91 79746 59860: D= 0 lag raha h mereko jitna samajh me aaya usse
12/27/20, 3:27 PM - +91 96508 99168: 10?
12/27/20, 3:28 PM - +91 96508 99168: Cox 2 will be the first pivot and for eliminating 4 we have to do R2-->R2-2R1
12/27/20, 3:28 PM - +91 79746 59860: Han han ban gaya
12/27/20, 3:28 PM - +91 79746 59860: Abhi abhi samajha mai 😀

12/27/20, 3:28 PM - +91 96508 99168: If d is 10 then second equation will be 0000 for which the systen will have no solution
12/27/20, 3:29 PM - +91 79746 59860: Yes
12/27/20, 3:29 PM - +91 79746 59860: Phir d= 11 krne se singular ho jayega
12/27/20, 7:06 PM - +91 88878 74339: Sir ne echelon form nhi padhaya na abhi?
12/27/20, 7:07 PM - +91 74568 74948: Nahi , atleast is name se to nahi bataya kuch bhi

12/27/20, 7:13 PM - +91 88878 74339: Okk thanks 👍
Mereko thoda lg rha tha ki kuch krvaya toh hai
12/27/20, 9:55 PM - +91 70244 45718: What is triangular system?

12/28/20, 8:04 PM - +91 88878 74339: Columns of S are independent are bs yahi reason hai det=0?
12/28/20, 8:15 PM - +91 73895 74818: Can one of admin share the this group link in 'IIIT NR Batch 2k20' many are not in this group they are asking doubts in that group
12/28/20, 8:35 PM - +91 90391 98542: Det kahan zero hai
12/28/20, 8:35 PM - +91 90391 98542: 1 hai
12/28/20, 8:36 PM - +91 88878 74339: Sorry det not zero
Is that the only explanation...?
12/28/20, 8:37 PM - +91 90391 98542: Nahin,shayad tak usko upper triangular form me convert karke uske 1st and 2nd column ka koi bhi combination 3rd column nahin de rha hai isliye uske column independent hai
12/28/20, 8:38 PM - +91 70331 23105: Haa det not equal to zero prove kr doge to independent likh sakte ho
12/28/20, 8:39 PM - +91 88878 74339: Maine yeh kra hai. 
But as Rahul said linear combination..
12/28/20, 8:40 PM - +91 88878 74339: Can someone plz send the pic of this prove by linear combination..
12/28/20, 8:41 PM - +91 74600 32517: Question no. 2 mei x ki toh infinite values hongi... Toh four components mei kya likhna hai??
Please help
12/28/20, 8:42 PM - +91 88878 74339: Multiply the matrix A and x .
X1, X2,X3,x4 ki values aa jaayengi
12/28/20, 8:42 PM - +91 74600 32517: Like in terms of b?
12/28/20, 8:42 PM - +91 88878 74339: Multiply and equate to b
12/28/20, 8:42 PM - +91 88878 74339: Yes
12/28/20, 8:42 PM - +91 74600 32517: Okay so it's similar to first question

Mereko isliye doubt ho rha kyuki hm det se linearly dep ya indep btate
12/28/20, 8:44 PM - +91 88878 74339: But isme columns pucha hai..
12/28/20, 8:44 PM - +91 70331 23105: Maine khud to waisei kiya hai
12/28/20, 8:45 PM - +91 70331 23105: Revant se bhi confirm kiya tha maine waisei krna hai

1/1/21, 4:28 PM - +91 94254 25099: Haan
1/1/21, 4:28 PM - +91 99938 63974: 👍🏻
1/1/21, 4:49 PM - +91 88878 74339: Why do everyone say that C is necessary for basics.
I mean all languages are different in syntax only.
So we can start with any language..
1/1/21, 4:49 PM - +91 88878 74339: So can anyone plz tell why C is preferred? Or are there more difference than syntax..?
1/1/21, 4:50 PM - ADHD CSE 4: simple
1/1/21, 4:50 PM - +91 79820 54591: It is because it is like you have to do everything from raw
1/1/21, 4:50 PM - ADHD CSE 4: I think with C we can get any job
1/1/21, 4:50 PM - +91 88878 74339: Python is more easy
1/1/21, 4:50 PM - +91 79820 54591: Python has inbuilt functions
1/1/21, 4:50 PM - ADHD CSE 4: any means anything....
1/1/21, 4:50 PM - +91 79820 54591: Not such things
1/1/21, 4:51 PM - +91 79820 54591: You can get with java tooo
1/1/21, 4:51 PM - ADHD CSE 4: any job in the sense small jobs also...
1/1/21, 4:51 PM - +91 88899 30610: Cause we can directly access memory and I been around for many decades
1/1/21, 4:51 PM - +91 79820 54591: And it works faster than other languages
1/1/21, 4:51 PM - ADHD CSE 4: yaa but
1/1/21, 4:51 PM - +91 79820 54591: 👍
1/1/21, 4:51 PM - +91 88899 30610: *it has
1/1/21, 4:51 PM - +91 88878 74339: Yes this we can say like, bcoz C was one of the first languages..
1/1/21, 4:51 PM - +91 88878 74339: But that doesn't make any difference
1/1/21, 4:52 PM - +91 79820 54591: You do sorting but not knowing how does bubble sort works is a problem
1/1/21, 4:52 PM - +91 79820 54591: Python or other languages has many things inbuilt
1/1/21, 4:53 PM - +91 88878 74339: Is it like get to knowing the backend stuff?
1/1/21, 4:53 PM - +91 79820 54591: C++ is almost equivalent to C...
1/1/21, 4:53 PM - +91 79820 54591: A sort of
1/1/21, 4:53 PM - +91 79820 54591: Like if u know every function how it works in python also then no problem in doing that👍
1/1/21, 4:54 PM - +91 73895 74818: It's more or like you study addition, subtraction ,multiplication and division even though you have a calculator maybe the same reason to get the essence of it
1/1/21, 4:54 PM - +91 88878 74339: Yes. If we know logic of program then any language
1/1/21, 4:55 PM - +91 88878 74339: What I wanna ask is that
Everyone says to learn C to know about backend stuff , like how compiler works and all that sort of things...
1/1/21, 4:55 PM - +91 83197 51315: Personally I think c++ is way better than c
1/1/21, 4:55 PM - +91 88878 74339: But as far as I know, we haven't been taught all these things till now in our programming class
1/1/21, 4:56 PM - +91 88878 74339: We r only taught syntaxes of C . Just like any other languages
1/1/21, 4:56 PM - +91 88899 30610: 2nd sem may JAVA hai
1/1/21, 4:57 PM - +91 88878 74339: Haan voh thik 👍
But questions remains intact.

Why most say first learn C . To learn how compiler , backend stuff works..?
1/1/21, 4:57 PM - +91 88878 74339: But abhi tk hme nhi btaya ..
1/1/21, 4:58 PM - +91 88899 30610: And 1st sem k it workshop may *Python* tha but that has been shifted to 2nd sem if I m not wrong
1/1/21, 4:58 PM - +91 88878 74339: Yes it has been shifted..
1/1/21, 5:01 PM - +91 88878 74339: Yrr kisi ke paas iska ans ho toh plz btana..

Bcoz I have been doing C just like any other language. No emphasis on how compiler works , and those sort of things..
1/1/21, 5:01 PM - +91 88878 74339: So I wanna clear ki I m not losing any information
1/1/21, 5:03 PM - +91 88899 30610: We don't need to learn how compiler works but we need to learn all C syntax and get a abstract idea on how that works
(if you are interested in compiler then you can go for higher studies on that)
1/1/21, 5:07 PM - +91 88878 74339: I m doing C language normally like other languages.
So I won't lose any crux or imp understanding of programming, right?
1/1/21, 5:25 PM - +91 88899 30610: Nope you r not gonna lose anything, at the end of the day C is also a programming language like others 
as far as I know
1/1/21, 5:27 PM - +91 73895 74818: Yes it's just that other languages were created to more easily give instructions to computer
1/1/21, 5:47 PM - +91 88878 74339: Okk thanks..👍😃
1/1/21, 6:12 PM - +91 99825 03901: When youll study C you'll get little depth in understanding of how Machine Language works too
1/1/21, 6:12 PM - +91 99825 03901: Its close to hardware than to programmer , 
Unlike Python or other modern languages
Which are closer to Programmer than to hardware
1/1/21, 6:12 PM - +91 88899 30610: ITP Lab questions:
1) Write a program in c to convert celsius into fahrenheit.

1/1/21, 8:29 PM - +91 74600 32517: Because of OOPS... It is said that C language teaches how programs work and to learn any language it's not just about syntax but also to know how it's working...
1/1/21, 8:30 PM - +91 88899 30610: C isn't a object oriented programming language

1/11/21, 1:02 PM - +91 88878 74339: It is recommended to join the group on Signal as we all know it is about data privacy..
1/11/21, 2:21 PM - +91 97632 14185: I think it will not be possible (due to time constraints) to handle 2-3 messengers (WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram).
So maybe we should switch to one messenger officially.
1/11/21, 2:22 PM - ADHD CSE 4: yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
1/11/21, 2:22 PM - +91 97632 14185: you can carry forward the groups in other messengers if you wish to do so.
but it will better if we all will be on the same messenger.
1/11/21, 2:22 PM - +91 88878 74339: I think if more than 60% joined the signal grp then we can leave this one..
1/11/21, 2:23 PM - +91 88899 30610: Good idea
1/11/21, 2:24 PM - +91 79746 59860: I think its only possible if we totally dissolve this group
1/11/21, 2:24 PM - +91 79746 59860: More effective
1/11/21, 2:24 PM - +91 88878 74339: Yes we will do that only after sufficient members join that grp..
1/11/21, 2:25 PM - +91 79746 59860: Okay then
1/11/21, 2:25 PM - +91 88899 30610: Let's give people some time to switch first
1/11/21, 2:25 PM - +91 79746 59860: Yea Cool
1/11/21, 2:28 PM - +91 97632 14185: Ok let's wait I will create a *Google form*. 
We will officially switch to the messenger which will get  *highest votes*.

Sresha Yadav nee Ghosh (Ph.D, IIT Roorkee)
Assistant Professor, IIIT-NR
1/11/21, 7:16 PM - +91 97632 14185: Dear All 

As per our first introduction class, I have already informed you that this semester you all have to undertake a field project on the theme “From Plantation to Caring" you all have to plant a tree and take care of it till the end of this semester.

 We divide this activity into 3 parts:

1-    First Plant a Tree: You can bring it from a nursery or your own created Sapling (Details of the plant you are going to grow, what are the benefits of that plant). Why you selected this plant.

[Pictures include plant in packet, plantation site with a pit, finally planted tree/plant.  

 

2-      Second Growth of the plant- Please take pictures of the plant every fortnight, showing the proper care and development of the plant.

 

3-      Third Presentation- Prepare a PPT presentation in the form of the project shown above showing the journey from plantation to development cycle.  

 

Instructions:

·         Every pic/photo submitted for the activity should have your presence. You should show how you are protecting the plant from damage and where you are planting the tree. Some Landmarks should also be notified either through nameplate or any other way to resemble that it is the same tree or plant you have grown.

 

·         On 15th March you all have to submit the PPT with details requested above and closing of PPT with your views towards ways to motivate the young generation to plant trees. Also you have to update how you felt during planting of the tree.

Awards

·         Innovation and creativity will attract additional points.

Penalties

·         Sharing your PPT (if two or students submit the similar presentation or with minor changes, the project marks will be equally distributed among all of them) and

·         plagiarism (two or more showing the same pics, both will get zero marks in first and second part).

1/12/21, 12:19 PM - Sainath IIITNR: I think there s a lot of misunderstanding about privacy and security that’s been articulated in many groups and especially on social media, as someone who is very particular about devices and accounts being secure let me dispel some of the myths, Whatsapp collects data, and a few days ago I posted a link here that shows what data Whatsapp collects about each individual, there is nothing new in that, Whatsapp has always been doing that from the beginning, Whatsapp has info on your phone number, other people s phone numbers in your contacts, your status updates and when you were last online. Since 2016 Whatsapp has been sharing that data with its parent company, Facebook. Whatsapp however has an option where an user can opt out of sharing the data with Facebook, how many in this group have ever exercised that option? I don’t think a single person here has exercised that option, now the only thing that has changed is -that option won’t be available anymore,  so post February 8th Whatsapp will be sharing everyone’s data with Facebook, which is already the case with most people, except the people who have exercised the option of not sharing their WA data with Facebook, that option won’t exist anymore. So technically nothing will change, your info is already shared with Facebook since 2016 and that will continue. The reason that Whatsapp is doing this is because Facebook wants to monetise their investments by targeted advertising and Facebook is doing this because phone manufacturers , especially Apple, are addressing privacy concerns and with Apple s iOS 14 update, Users have to give consent to being tracked by Facebook. So for people who are troubled by this there are other options like Telegram and Signal, Telegram is a Russian app and it’s management is shrouded in secrecy, they keep changing their operational headquarters and Telegram like Whatsapp is not an altruistic venture and they too want to monetise their investments and they are also building a platform for targeted advertising, and also Telegram is not completely end to end encrypted and they store all user data with their decryption keys on their servers and Telegram has been hacked many times and most famously in Iran, where data about millions of accounts were stolen. That leaves only Signal, Signal was founded by Brian Acton, one of the creators and founders of Whatsapp, after he sold Whatsapp to Facebook. Signal is end to end encrypted and doesn’t collect much data except your phone number.. and your data is not saved on servers but your device. Signal is run by a non profit organisation and doesn’t want to monetise their investments and is run by ‘donations’, because Signals working model is altruistic and their funding is based on donations only, I seriously doubt that they can scale up to manage much more  than the users they already have, running a messaging app requires lot of investments in technology, especially big servers , Signal has about 40 million users now, and if more migrate there rapidly, their systems will crash and it has already happened and I don’t know how a non profit messaging app can survive catering to hundreds of millions or a Billion users. Also since Signal s data is not stored on on a Server/Cloud but locally on your device, so every time you buy a new phone  you will have to manually transfer your old Signal messages and data, and there is nothing much you can do if your phone crashes.
1/12/21, 12:26 PM - +91 96968 00234: <Media omitted>
1/12/21, 12:32 PM - +91 97632 14185: Got your point 
But as you know that cyphercell shifted to signal due to new privacy policy of whatsapp

And I think these guys know about the privacy policy better than us.

1/17/21, 1:41 PM - +91 89573 79644: 0100
1/17/21, 1:41 PM - Dinesh IIITNR: Why not 1010
1/17/21, 1:41 PM - +91 89573 79644: Both are right
1/17/21, 1:42 PM - Dinesh IIITNR: Thanks bhai

1/17/21, 1:43 PM - +91 89573 79644: Bas agar self complementing kahe to 0100 likhna baki to dono sahi hai
1/17/21, 1:43 PM - +91 89573 79644: Use pebble
1/17/21, 1:43 PM - +91 73890 12933: Ok
1/17/21, 1:44 PM - +91 98053 53033: We can't write 1010 because 4's code is complement of 5's code..
1/17/21, 1:44 PM - +91 89573 79644: But that is when it is defined that we are writing self complement code otherwise both can be written
1/17/21, 2:16 PM - +91 94542 01864: UNIT 1 will also come in data   analytics quiz
1/17/21, 2:17 PM - +91 96508 99168: Who told

1/17/21, 5:20 PM - +91 70331 23105: #include <stdio.h>
void main()
{
int a = 3;
int b = ++a + a++ + --a;
printf("Value of b is %d", b);
}
1/17/21, 5:20 PM - +91 70331 23105: Iska output 13 aara meko lagta hai 12 aana chahie🤔
1/17/21, 5:20 PM - +91 70331 23105: Kisi k paas koi logic h 13 q hoga
1/17/21, 5:24 PM - +91 88878 74339: First ++a will make value of a =4
We get here
4+5+4
1/17/21, 5:24 PM - +91 70331 23105: Why 4+5+4
1/17/21, 5:24 PM - +91 70331 23105: Second one is a++ right
1/17/21, 5:25 PM - +91 70331 23105: First 4 will be added then it will become 5 right before the third operation 🤔
1/17/21, 5:25 PM - +91 70331 23105: Step 1 : b= 4.      a=4
Step 2:  b=.8.      a=5
Step 3:. b=12.      a=4
1/17/21, 5:26 PM - +91 70331 23105: I was getting 12 according to this👆
1/17/21, 5:26 PM - +91 79820 54591: Same 12 should be the output
1/17/21, 5:26 PM - +91 88514 14210: I also think 12
1/17/21, 5:26 PM - +91 70331 23105: Compiler is showing 13🤷
1/17/21, 5:27 PM - +91 88514 14210: Did you execute??
1/17/21, 5:27 PM - +91 79820 54591: Print b at every step then observe
1/17/21, 5:27 PM - +91 70331 23105: #include <stdio.h>
void main()
{
int a = 3;
int b = ++a ;
b=b + a++;
b=b + --a;
printf("Value of b is %d\n", b);
}
1/17/21, 5:27 PM - +91 70331 23105: M getting 12 for this one
1/17/21, 5:27 PM - +91 79820 54591: Dono to same h

1/17/21, 5:28 PM - +91 70331 23105: First me 13 hai 
Second me 12
1/17/21, 5:29 PM - +91 70331 23105: I know this bro compiler galat nhi hoga I want the explanation
1/17/21, 5:29 PM - +91 70331 23105: Why 13 ?
1/17/21, 5:29 PM - +91 88878 74339: a=4
If we have  
B=a++
We will get b=4
Right?
1/17/21, 5:29 PM - +91 88878 74339: I m trying to give explanation..
1/17/21, 5:29 PM - +91 70331 23105: Yes then?

1/18/21, 11:58 AM - +91 88899 30610: Now x = x&&y||z
Look at rhs

x&&y||z 

as && has higher precedence it will be evaluated first

2&&1 = 1
Now 1||z 
That is 1||0 = 1
therefore x = 1
1/18/21, 11:59 AM - +91 76900 22378: But it is showing output 2
1/18/21, 12:00 PM - +91 88878 74339: It is showing 1

As per my discussion with you all, A lab exam of ICP course has been scheduled on Monday i.e., 25 Jan, 2021. The following instructions will be followed during lab exam. 

 

1. I will share the lab question paper exactly at 4 PM and the total duration of the exam is 1 hour i.e., 4-5 PM. 

 

2. I will accept only hand-written copy as answer sheet of the lab exam. I will not accept .doc, .pdf or any other file format. So, you need to write the complete program in the paper and then it is required to send scan copy of the same.



3. I will share a Google link for uploading your scan copy file. It is mandatory to write your name, roll number and branch in the hand-written file.



4. The Google form will be automatically disabled at 5.05 PM. So, submit the file as per the given time. 


5. There will be total two programs.

1/31/21, 12:36 PM - +91 99825 03901: WAAAATTTT
1/31/21, 12:37 PM - +91 74568 74948: If someone else can confirm ans for probability to stop at 58
1/31/21, 12:37 PM - +91 88899 30610: You should look into what a fair wheel is then you will understand
1/31/21, 12:38 PM - +91 88878 74339: 1/101 hoga na?

1/31/21, 5:40 PM - +91 73895 74818: It's given that box 2 is selected we don't need to take it's prob into account
1/31/21, 5:41 PM - +91 88878 74339: Conditional probability use hogi na?
1/31/21, 5:41 PM - +91 79748 38817: nahi
1/31/21, 5:41 PM - +91 88878 74339: Toh?

1/31/21, 5:42 PM - +91 88878 74339: Bhai condition di gyi hai ki box 2 is selected and in these type we use conditional prob

1/31/21, 6:08 PM - +91 74568 74948: I guess unhone jo wheel assume kiya it was discreetly marked and pointer could have stopped even between two marks but fair wheels mai generally aisa hota nahi hai, pura sector mark hota hai
1/31/21, 6:08 PM - +91 73895 74818: Ha
1/31/21, 6:09 PM - +91 86026 16019: ha mai bhi pehle confuse ho gya tha

2/3/21, 11:34 AM - +91 86026 16019: Interview session can be an open-ended session since we can instantly ask questions from the answers that they have given.

Certain phrases should be used so that session goes smoothly.

Body language should be maintained during interview because depending on the signals of non verbal questions you will get sementic responses.

Record the session so that we can analyse body language and write the transcript.

Speaking and listening should get hand in hand,they are the most important skills.

You can encourage the speaker by using certain phrases.

You should acknowledge the speaker.

You should immediately ask question if you have any doubt.




I have noted some points of mam,hope they will be useful for you.

To listen is an effort, and just to hear is no merit. A duck hears also, so here is Capriccio with an online antakshari event, *FUN-takshari*, where you can sing as much as you want to without being noticed whether or not you sing good.
All students who are interested can refer to the rulebook attached and fill the google form to participate.

Those who wish to sing, always find a song.

2/11/21, 3:36 PM - +91 88899 30610: Hello Everyone!
Do you have any plans for this Valentine's Day? Given that you are in an engineering institute and also, most of you haven't even met your classmates yet, we guess the answer is sadly N-O! 
Don't worry, Inquizitive has got it all covered. We will be conducting an entertainment quiz (we won't of course bore you with history-current-affairs-blah-blah) this Sunday (14th Feb). Interesting? No? Well, to add some spice to it we decided that the quiz will be conducted in a pair of boy and girl (to be decided by you). You have exactly 3 days from now to get yourself a "quiz date"! 
Also, spoiler alert!!! This won't be just a quiz, you need to also know about your quiz partner as we may ask some questions on that. 
Hurry up, gather some courage and ask him/her! - "Kya tum mere saath quiz pe chaloge?" and thank me later.  

Fill the google form - https://forms.gle/cZTH8KCBkrKLSHmB7
& have a look at the poster :)
See you all!

2/12/21, 12:22 PM - +91 88899 30610: We've been receiving a lot of requests demanding a change in rules. So, here-we-go: 
1. Given the cruel gender ratio - now boys can bring their quiz partners from outside the Institute. 
2. You (only boys) can even have same-gender pairing [coz why not?🏳‍🌈] - also if you pass the prelims, you will be starting the quiz with -25 points.
3. If you need any more relaxation in the rules, kindly revert back to this mail, we may consider it on a case-to-case basis. 
4. Girls wondering - "What about us?" - Well, look around there is an ocean of boys out there (in our insti) ready to partner with you FOR THE QUIZ.

2/16/21, 8:05 PM - +91 88899 30610: Hey guys,

The literary club is debuting its book summit!

I'm sure everyone has read a book sometime which made them go, this is the real deal gotta tell my mate to read this. but more often than not your friends might not share the same enthusiasm for books(which is totally okay btw).

Welcome to Pitch Perfect

Here comes your stage to meet fellow book lovers and discuss your favourite titles. Pitch Perfect is a book pitching event where you pitch your favourite book.

Event date: 19th February

Time: 6 PM

This is more of a conversation with fellow book nerds than an event, where you get 5 minutes to share your favorite book and why everyone should read that. The genre doesn't matter: action, adventure, non-fiction everything's fine.(even erotica, that is if you're fine with the whispering when you walk around the campus)

*Register Here:* https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LpAjjIDSyXg83JmlPKhGGa3LYU-8JLvUREbR4QQ7EJU/edit?usp=sharing

2/16/21, 11:22 PM - +91 73930 40493: Sir,
This mail is representing the concerns of all the first-year (2020-2024 Batch) students. It is to bring to your attention that the students are having doubts regarding the institute reopening ever since we received the mail regarding the same. 

Some of the concerns are:

1) The time given to join the college in physical mode is too little to make arrangements since many of the students are from outside Chhattisgarh.

2)  After the commencement of the offline classes, the mode of examination/evaluation is unclear.

3) Since the order to join the offline classes came on such short notice, some students are facing problems in getting a suitable/affordable mode of transportation to reach the Institute.

4) Some students are having doubts regarding the hostel/mess fees since the students will be joining the institute merely for almost eight days in February. 

5) Since the deadline to submit the "parents undertaking form" is 18th Feb and it's already 17th, all the doubts of the students need to be clarified before the time.

The students will face difficulty in arranging for all the prerequisites and attending the online classes at the same time until they reach the institute campus, so we humbly request the respected authority to kindly help us with some free days before reporting at the institute so that the situations don't force us to miss the classes.

It would be too kind of you if you or any other concerned faculty could arrange a session with the first-year students to clear their doubts so that they could submit the parents undertaking form before the allotted time.

Thanks for your time
Regards
Batch of Btech-2024

*This is the mail that am sending to the dean academics on behalf of our batch so as to get all our doubts regarding the college reopening cleared. Any/Every suggestion is welcomed*

3/8/21, 3:40 PM - +91 73895 74818: Dear All 

As per our first introduction class, I have already informed you that this semester you all have to undertake a field project on the theme “From Plantation to Caring" you all have to plant a tree and take care of it till the end of this semester.

 We divide this activity into 3 parts:

1-    First Plant a Tree: You can bring it from a nursery or your own created Sapling (Details of the plant you are going to grow, what are the benefits of that plant). Why you selected this plant.

[Pictures include plant in packet, plantation site with a pit, finally planted tree/plant.  

 

2-      Second Growth of the plant- Please take pictures of the plant every fortnight, showing the proper care and development of the plant.

 

3-      Third Presentation- Prepare a PPT presentation in the form of the project shown above showing the journey from plantation to development cycle.  

 

Instructions:

·         Every pic/photo submitted for the activity should have your presence. You should show how you are protecting the plant from damage and where you are planting the tree. Some Landmarks should also be notified either through nameplate or any other way to resemble that it is the same tree or plant you have grown.

 

·         On 15th March you all have to submit the PPT with details requested above and closing of PPT with your views towards ways to motivate the young generation to plant trees. Also you have to update how you felt during planting of the tree.

Awards

·         Innovation and creativity will attract additional points.

Penalties

·         Sharing your PPT (if two or students submit the similar presentation or with minor changes, the project marks will be equally distributed among all of them) and

·         plagiarism (two or more showing the same pics, both will get zero marks in first and second part).

As you have received the timetable, you have seen there is a total of 12 subjects running simultaneously. To reduce the load, we have decided to divide the total subjects into two halves, which will be offered in half-semester. This arrangement will reduce the screen time and also minimizes the number of parallel subjects.  The division of courses are as follows:
First Half: April 19 to June 22
1. HS102C: Communication and Discourse Strategies
2. EC202C: Sensors and Actuators
3. MA105C: Statistics
4. MA103C: Calculus
5. IT Workshop I
6. DA103I: 3D Printing
7. CS103C: Introduction to IoT    
Second half: June 28 to August 25
1. MA104C: Optimization Techniques
2. DA103C: Introduction to AI and ML
3. EC102C: Digital Signal Processing
4. CS102C: Object-Oriented Programming-I
5. IT Workshop II 
6. DA103I: 3D Printing
7. CS103C: Introduction to IoT  

Subjects like 3D Printing and Introduction to IoT will run the whole semester (April 19 to August 15). Evaluation of each subject will be communicated by the respective faculty member. 
You will be received the revised timetable by tomorrow. However, classes will be conducted in the same slots, same link of the respective subjects related to that half.
If any confusion, please send me a mail.
thanks
Rajarshi

It's been ages since we met. We know there's a pandemic out there and you're frustrated with your assignments, quizzes, and minor evaluation. Let’s take a few minutes to bring out the competitive beast inside you and test your general knowledge of technology.

Today is an auspicious day. Do you remember what's special about today? No? Let me give you a hint, 23 years back on this day, we duped the CIA and did something big in our country which shocked the entire world.

Still couldn't get it? Well, that's what the quiz is all about.  Only individual participation is allowed.

Also, all the questions are prepared by our core members from the first year. Let's see if you can answer them.

 

Date and Time - Today - 11th May, 6 PM

Venue - Google Meet + Kahoot - meet.google.com/hsy-wixk-oga

 

See you all at 6:00 PM!

As Covid continues to test our mental strength & makes way beyond metros, vaccination is the only saviour.
There are folks who are unable to use Cowin website to check slots,parents/relatives/support staff 

*Zeapl* has built a simple tool on Whatsapp in Hindi/English  to let everyone find vaccination slots.
Just share the link with one person, who needs this simplified tool to get protected 💉 #PowerofOne

1. please dont explain what S W O T means , everyone knows what it means , if its already in your slide you may or may not remove it (please skip that slide while presenting)
But please don’t explain the full form of SWOT 

2. No need to hide your goals, your competition is not with these 60 students in your batch , but with the bigger world , Work together with these 60 students to reach your goals instead.

As you all know, the IoT projects titles are defined at the beginning of the semester, it includes prototype design using Hardware.

This semester you have similar kinds of courses such as *Sensor and Actuator, IT workshop-2.*  Hope, you are not producing the same hardware prototype in the other two courses.  If any one finds this practice, it will be treated very seriously and will take necessary action against them.

Thanks

We hope you all are in good health.

Books are the carriers of civilization. Without books, history is silent, literature dumb, science crippled, thought and speculation at any standstill.

Thus,  it is very important to read. A person who doesn't read is not better than a person who can't read. To inculcate the interest of literature in young readers and writers of today, Mr Sanjay Chandra is coming to present his session on "Literature: A perspective for young adults". It's a great opportunity for all the young reading and writing enthusiasts to interact and discuss their literature interests with sir. Starting his carrier as an engineer and discovering various other fields, Mr Sanjay is now a storyteller. His first book - The life and times of a common man' was published in 2019. 

Date- 30th October 2021

Hope you all are doing well. As you all know, the deadline for the *Solving for India Hackathon's* first round of project submissions is tomorrow. We are reminding you to submit your projects by the end of today, *as tomorrow is Sunday and the last day to submit them*.

Please note that all the stakeholders are closely monitoring the submission process, and it is crucial for your college to have a good number of project submissions. *Zero submissions from your college will negatively impact Google and AMD*.

For those of you who have completed 50% to 80% of your project and are unable to complete it by tomorrow, you can still submit what you have done so far.

Please ensure that all the projects are uploaded and submitted on the landing page provided.

We wish you all the best of luck with your projects and hope to see your submissions soon.

Remember, earlier we asked to share the Github links to check your progress report, but now you need to submit it so that your projects can be reviewed from there only.

Cover to Cover, in collaboration with Take da Bait, is hosting the event 'DISCEPTATIO', a debate competition where you will get a chance to put your thoughts forward and make your voice heard on the topic:

Brain Drain: Is the International migration of Indian youth worth justifying?

It is common for students to leave immediately after finishing their studies at any of our country's prestigious institutions. A significant portion of the money invested in these bright minds benefits corporations in first-world countries. However, the remuneration they receive in our country for their skills is insufficient. Is it a good idea to get into one of the best colleges in the country, finish your degree, and then use your degree to make money for others?

The details of the competition are as follows:
Date: 13th January 2022
Time: 6:30 Onwards
Platform: Google Meet
Rules are in the given doc - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EBUKrJkNgcrZbu7P1hzfZdJmDow8y9qVlc_rSwmJ9Nw/edit

Interested candidates can register themselves using the link given here: https://forms.gle/YcUKUnCX8usEdoLf9 
Entries will be considered till 2:00 PM, 13th January 2022

"Education is not a tool for development - individual, community and the nation. It is the foundation for our future. It is empowerment to make choices and encourages the youth to chase their dreams."
-Nita Ambani

Looking forward to the prompt responses!!
Have a pleasant day ahead!

Aaraha hai ek dhamakedar event, aapke, mere aur sabke favorite club C2C ki taraf se!!


Kahaniyan hi vo zariya hai, jisse hum duniya tak apne dukh, apne sukh, apne sapne, apne nazariya logo tak pahucha pate hai…aur kabhi kabhi kuch hasi ke palo ka bhi maza lete hai

We bring to you the “MIDNIGHT COMIC CRISIS”. To put it simply: it's midnight, you're in the middle of a crisis, and you have to bring out your inner comic!


The event will start with us giving you all the first few lines to a dramatic narrative. You will have to continue it: be as wild as you like! (baaki cringe hua to tumhara hi ghata hai) You will be given 1 minute to flourish your tale, after that; the baton is handed to someone else. They will have to make do with the mess you made.


It's an event to bring out the torch pakad kar kahani sunane wala, dusro ki sun kar khud ki shekhi bagharne wala, embarrassing incident mai bhi khud ko hero banane wala in all of us.

Miliye humse, 21st January, shaam 6 baje, GMeet par. Bhasha? Jaisi aapki shraddha (hindi aur english hi options hai).

8/9/22, 12:37 PM - +91 74772 10884: The Covid-19 pandemic has arguably been the biggest crisis of this century across the globe. In India, its impact was felt drastically on almost all sectors of governance, particularly health, economy & education. The second wave of covid in particular proved to be deadliest causing acute shortage of oxygen & other medical facilities claiming thousands of lives & leaving lakhs unemployed.

Was the government’s response, planning & execution to face this crisis timely & adequate? How do you rate government’s covid management strategies?


The journey through this ongoing pandemic has been a fairly personal one for most of us & we are bound to have developed our own set of experiences, opinions & suggestions about the way it was tackled.


With Podium 2.0, Model United Nations (MUN) is trying to provide a platform to lay out all your feelings regarding the way government handled the covid situation, be it criticism or praise, anger or gratitude, disappointment or pride.


It’s an open discussion where you can share your opinions freely like an ordinary factual conversation with your peers.


Please fill out the attached form, latest by August 11, to register for the event.
